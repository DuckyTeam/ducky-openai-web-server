Ingredients:

For the marinade:
- 1 kg goat meat, cut into pieces
- 1/2 cup plain yogurt
- 1 tablespoon ginger paste
- 1 tablespoon garlic paste
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
- Salt to taste

For the curry:
- 3 tablespoons cooking oil or ghee
- 2 large onions, finely chopped
- 2-3 green chilies, slit lengthwise
- 2 teaspoons ginger paste
- 2 teaspoons garlic paste
- 2 tomatoes, finely chopped
- 2 teaspoons coriander powder
- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1 tablespoon red chili powder
- 1 tablespoon garam masala
- 1 bay leaf
- 4 cups water
- Fresh cilantro (coriander leaves) for garnish

Instructions:

1. Start by marinating the goat meat. In a large bowl, combine the goat meat with the yogurt, ginger paste, garlic paste, turmeric powder, and salt. Leave it to marinate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight in the refrigerator.

2. Heat the oil or ghee in a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.

3. Add the chopped onions and green chilies to the pot and fry until the onions become golden brown.

4. Then, add the ginger and garlic paste, and cook for a couple more minutes until the raw smell disappears.

5. Add the chopped tomatoes, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, bay leaf, and garam masala. Stir well and cook until the tomatoes are soft and the spices are well blended.

6. Add the marinated goat meat to the pot and cook on high heat for about 5-7 minutes, stirring frequently to ensure the meat is well-coated with the spices.

7. Add water, cover the pot, and simmer on low heat for about 1.5-2 hours until the meat is tender and the flavors are well combined. You can also use a pressure cooker to reduce the cooking time.

8. Check the seasoning and adjust according to your taste.

9. Garnish with fresh cilantro before serving.

10. Your delicious goat curry is ready to be served. Enjoy it hot with steamed rice or Indian breads like naan or roti.

Note: 
- The key to a delicious goat curry is to cook it slowly over low heat. This allows the flavors to develop and the meat to become tender.
- Adjust the amount of spices according to your taste and spice tolerance level.
